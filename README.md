Student Grade System Project
Overview

The Student Grade System project is a Python script that calculates a student's grade based on their marks obtained in five subjects. The program prompts the user to enter the marks obtained in each subject, calculates the total and average marks, and then determines the grade based on the average marks.

Key Features:

Prompts the user to enter marks obtained in five subjects
Calculates the total and average marks
Determines the grade based on the average marks
Displays the total marks, average marks, and grade to the user
Provides additional feedback based on the average marks, such as distinction, credit, pass, or need to improve performance
How it Works:

The user is prompted to enter the marks obtained in each of the five subjects.
The program calculates the total marks by adding up the marks obtained in each subject.
The program calculates the average marks by dividing the total marks by 5.
Based on the average marks, the program determines the grade using a set of predefined criteria.
The program displays the total marks, average marks, and grade to the user.
The program also provides additional feedback based on the average marks, such as distinction, credit, pass, or need to improve performance.
Benefits:

Easy to use: The program is simple and intuitive, making it easy for students to calculate their grades.
Accurate: The program accurately calculates the total and average marks, ensuring that the grade is determined correctly.
Informative: The program provides additional feedback to the student, helping them to understand their performance and identify areas for improvement.
Applications:

The Student Grade System project can be used by students to calculate their grades and track their performance.
The program can be used by teachers or educators to calculate grades for their students.
The program can be modified and extended to include additional features, such as storing student data, generating reports, or providing personalized feedback.
